# 🩺 X-ray Chest Classification App

An **AI-powered application** for classifying common thoracic pathologies from chest X-ray images.  
This project utilizes **Transfer Learning** with a fine-tuned Deep Learning model (**DenseNet121**) and is deployed as a user-friendly web application using **Streamlit**.

The model is a **multi-label classifier** trained to detect multiple findings commonly associated with chest-related conditions, offering a comprehensive assessment.
